# gns3server-headless

This repo is dedicated to GNS3 software (www.gns3.com) with the main goal to run a headless remote server and to ease the intial installation of all required components.

## Purpose

Looking at ressource intensive LABs for GNS3 or Images it can be necessary to run on different server to get the power you need.
Along with all software GNS3 is managing, it can be quiet challenging to install a fully working GNS3 server, especially in a headless deployment.
